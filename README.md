# Sleep-Saver-PC-Shutdown-Scheduler
#Why
I created the Scheduler because I love falling asleep to music playing on my laptop at night. However, I often found myself waking up in the middle of the night to turn off the laptop or forgetting to do so altogether, leading to unnecessary power consumption. So, I built this handy web app. Now, before I go to bed, I simply set my Scheduler and turn on my music. I know that after a certain number of minutes, once I've drifted off to sleep, the Scheduler will automatically turn off my PC. This not only helps in reducing power consumption but also curbs my habit of needing music to fall asleep.

#Process
Welcome to this tutorial on creating a PC shutdown scheduler web app using Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS. We'll build an intuitive interface that lets you schedule your PC to shut down after a specified time, cancel the shutdown if needed, and display a countdown timer. First, we'll set up a Flask server to handle the scheduling and cancellation requests. Next, we'll create an index.html file for the web interface and a styles.css file for professional styling. We'll implement the shutdown logic in Python using os.system and threading for timing. Finally, we'll enhance the interface with JavaScript to show a real-time countdown timer. Run the Flask app and access it in your browser to manage your PC's shutdown schedule easily. Let's get started!
